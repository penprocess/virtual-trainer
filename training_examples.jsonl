In a fired heater, the fuel (usually gas or oil) is burned at the burners to produce a flame.\n\nThe heat produced by this combustion is then transferred to the process fluid that circulates through the tubes of the furnace. This heat transfer occurs through three methods:\n\n1. Radiation: The heat from the flame radiates to the surrounding tubes containing the process fluid.\n2. Convection: The heated process fluid moves away from the heat source, carrying the heat with it, and is replaced by cooler fluid that is then heated.\n3.
